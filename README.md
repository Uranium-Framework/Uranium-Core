# Sunrise Framework

Sunrise Framework is a new powerful framework for easier Roblox development.

Sunrise's main purpose is to make development easier for new developers, we try to achieve this by making as easy to understand API as possible. Sunrise uses many great libraries as well as [Knit](https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit) to seamlessly bridge the gap between the server and the client. Not only that, Sunrise allows for better and easier data sharing between all Sunrise modules!

Most of the API is made with future updates thus the function might seem very close to the library they are made with! As we update the framework these functions will change and get better and better.
